Hey Guys! Thanks for checking out Be A Bird! As of now the game is free (and is planned to be) so if you paid it was a SCAM and thee money was wasted.
If you have a mod all YOU have to do is go to the scratch page (which will be linked at the end), do whatever you want, and package it! That simple.
I used Turbowarp Packager to package this but you can use ANYTHING to package. I hope you enjoyed the game!
